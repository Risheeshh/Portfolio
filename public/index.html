        <p>Growing up in a family of doctors can be tough but one of software engineers? 
        <br /> 
        A whole different story. A very twisted big boss drama kind of story. Talking of stories, let's go through mine. I've had most of my early schooling from Loyola School (till the end of string again)(inside joke). I then moved on to Mother's Public School to complete the last two years of my high school. 
        <br />
        
        Since then I've been pursuinng BTech in Computer Science and engineering in the glorious piece of instituition that is Manipal University Jaipur (many allegedly refute this claim). I'm a fresher and am suffering under a mountain of due assignments.
        <br />
        I'm a wee bit tall, a wee bit funny, a wee bit smort and I like to poke around techy stuff. AI and ML has got most of my attention as of now but I don't really do favourites. And well lo and behold this is my humble PORTFOLIO</p>
